  <h1>Hello, World! My name is Ray and I yearn to learn about making web pages</h1>
  <p>Selections from CWD Index</p>
  <html>I am a ATEC general senior who will graduate fall 2026. </html>
  <body>I want to work in UX after I graduate. </body>
  <a>I want to learn more about web design and coding to improve my prospects in that field. </a>
  <o1>This sentence was written with the o1 element. The br element was used for a line break. </o1> <br>
  <a>I am excited to see how this class can help me learn how to create websites in a fun and accessible way.</a> <br>

  <p>This website explains how Alexa works. It explains both the hardware 
    (the microphones that allow the device to hear the user) and the software 
    (the AI agent that gauges how well Alexa responded to the user’s voice command). 
    It then goes on to explain the materials required to make an Alexa device and 
    the time and processes that create these materials (specifically lithium). 
    It pulls sources from history to make the user consider the ideas behind Alexa 
    and how these ideas have been translated across  history to her final design.

  <p>This website shows a horse made through keyboard characters. Its legs will 
    stretch as far down as the user scrolls. </p>
  <a href="https://thezen.zone">thezen.zone</a> <br> 
  <p>This website offers 3 forms of meditation, each with the option to do the 
    activity once, three times, and five times. One, the swirl, has the user erase a 
    spiral, another, has the user toggle a block of switches, and the final has the 
    user hover their mouse above a set of 4 circles until they are smaller and smaller 
    circles. After the user completes the activity, they are told how long they’ve been 
    meditating for, though the “breaking” activity wildly overstates the amount of time 
    spent on the activity.
